Although I do not yet have any fully functioning examples of websites I have developed, I have worked on already existing websites and am currently working on my own website. While this doesn't seem like much, it has given me exposure to website implementation and structure. Website development is interesting because it often requires you to combine seemingly unrelated things in order to create a finished product. For example, take the login page of any website. In order to create a secure and functioning login page, various languages are often used together. HTML is used to create visual interfaces for users, javascript then can be used to make these interfaces interactive, and then php and sql can be used to check if input specified by the user matches a username and password in a database.
  
Realizing that different programming languages with different functionalities could be utilized together was a shock for me because I only had experience writing programs using a single language. Just like in the picture above, sometimes programs or websites are like a city, they require multiple different parts each with different functions to run properly.
