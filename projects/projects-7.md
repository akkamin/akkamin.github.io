For an undergraduate research project I joined a team working with the Magic Leap augmented reality headset.  The ultimate goal of the project is to eventually use augmented or virtual reality to get kids with eating problems to eat. Since the project was just started, we wanted to show the clinitians who work with the kids thd differnt features the Magic Leap system has to offer. Using the Unity editor we created a demo showing the various features available in Magic Leap and walked the clinitions through the demo.
