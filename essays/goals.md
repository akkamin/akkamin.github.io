  Life without a goal is very hard (at least in my opinion). During high school and even for the first few years of college I had no goals. I would only do things for instant satisfaction. It was an easy life without direction or worry, but it was a hollow life. It was as if everything I did lacked substance. Slowly though, I began to notice this problem and took small steps to address it. 

  The first step I took was finding a job. The main goal of this was to teach myself more responsibility and find out if I liked or disliked the job I was applying for. The second part was important because if I didn't like the job, I was hoping it would give me some incentive to try and find something that I actually would enjoy doing as work. Overall, the job was a mixed success. While I still work at that same job even today, at first I couldn't manage my time well and ended up stressing myself out. And although my life wasn't quite as hollow anymore, I became a grumpy old man who got angry over every little thing. 
    
  This work/school life continued for some time until one semester after seeing some of the programs people had made in a computer science course, I decided to give computer science a try. The class I ended up taking was ICS 111. That course was the first course in college that I actually enjoyed and more importantly, it gave me a goal. 
      
  The difference between working towards a goal and just working is huge. It wasn't until I actually had a goal that I realized the difference. It becomes so easy to work towards something you actually want to do. Although I was fortunate enough to have enough time to find a goal, unfortunately that is not the case for everyone. Even when you search really hard for a goal, sometimes its just luck and coincidence that you're lacking. The main thing is not to stop searching. The great thing about living in Hawaii and the U.S in general is that regardless of circumstances, no one can stop you from trying to find a goal (unless it is illegal), so keep searching until you find it.
