<h1>UH book forum</h1>

Authors, Ky Ho, Aidan Akamine

At UH Manoa we have noticed that there is a lack of students who enjoy reading as a medium of entertainment. Being that UH is supposed to be a higher learning institution this is rather sad. We think that the reason may be that students are not interested in reading books alone. Thus, if we were to create a solution that brings people with the same “unique” interests in books together, this may increase the amount of students who read in leisure. 

The site will have a signup page that only allows UH affiliated individuals to join. Users will then be able to have their own interest page in which they can customize/categorize their favorite book genres to assist in getting users with the same interests to meet up. Users can then create public chat rooms based off of specific interests to connect with other users with similar “tastes”. Users then will also be able to add onto a page with categorized interest and add their favorite ways of consuming their “tastes”. All users will have a public profile to display their favorite books and what they are currently reading with a rating system.
